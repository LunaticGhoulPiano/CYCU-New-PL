2021 spring, PL project 3 (OurScheme Project 3)

Due : 6/27, 2021(Sunday) before midnight

==================================================================

For this project, you need to extend EvalSExp(), so that it is capable of
evaluating user-defined functions.

In order to do so, you must first extend your implementation of DEFINE, so
that the user can define a function before he/she calls such a function.

You also need to allow the creation and use of "local definitions" via the
use of the 'let' construct.

The use of "nameless functions" (via the use 'lambda') should also be allowed.

In other words, the main focus of Proj. 3 consists of three special "forms":
'let', 'lambda', and 'define'.

In addition, you must also handle error cases (see Part II below).
